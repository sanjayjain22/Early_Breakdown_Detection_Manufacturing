 Typical paper manufacturing setup.
 
## DESCRIPTION
* Paper Manufacturing is a continuos process. A paper machine runs round-the-clock to continuosly roll out reels of paper.
* Paper Breaks are faced almost every day as paper sheets are very brittle.
* Breakdowns causes losses between $10K - $20K for mid-size plants and respectively higher amounts for larger plants.
* And even worse, the workers have to enter hazardous areas to inspect and restore the machine.

## SOLUTION PROPOSAL
* We intend to build a model which can detect these breakdowns before they occur, so that the operator can minimize the risk of breakdowns by adjusting the variables.
 
## DATASET
The provided data has,
* 18,398 records.
* Columns:
– time: the timestamp of the row
– y: the binary response variable. There are only 124 rows with y = 1, rest are y = 0.
– x1-x61: predictor variables. All the predictors are continuous variables, except x28 and x61. x61 is a binary variable, and x28 is a
categorical variable. All the predictors are centered. 
Besides, the predictors are a mixture of raw materials and process variables. 
Their descriptions are omitted for data anonymity.

## Feature Engineering & Modelling
 *  Feature engineering and modelling is explained in the Ipython notebook attatched.
