 Typical paper manufacturing setup.
 
 ## DESCRIPTION
 
 * Paper Manufacturing is a continuos process. A paper machine runs round-the-clock to continuosly roll out reels of paper.
 * Paper Breaks are faced almost every day as paper sheets are very brittle.
 * Breakdowns causes losses between $10K - $20K for mid-size plants and higher amounts for larger plants.
 * And even worse, the workers have to enter hazardous areas to inspect and restore the machine.
 
 ## SOLUTION PROPOSAL
 
 * We intend to build a model which can detect these breakdowns before they occur, so that the operator can minimize the risk of breakdowns by adjusting the variables.
